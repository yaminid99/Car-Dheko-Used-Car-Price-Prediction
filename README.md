Car Dheko - Used Car Price Prediction
This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the prices of used cars, enhancing customer experience by providing accurate price estimates. 
The model is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

Author: Yamini Devi

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Extensive cleaning and feature engineering on car data, including encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights derived from univariate, bivariate, and multivariate visualizations, along with correlation analysis.
Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were evaluated, with Random Forest chosen for deployment due to its superior performance.
Streamlit App: A user-friendly interface where users can input car details to get instant price predictions. Integrated with a Random Forest model for high accuracy.

Python Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

Methods should be strictly follows to exact output will come.
1. Understand car Dheko user documentation
2. unstructured to structured data - Car Dheko file
3. Data cleaning - Data Preprocessing car Dheko
4. Data preprocessing ML - car Dheko Machine learning, MLpart
5. streamlit - car dheko app
6. picture - streamlit background
Deployment: Hosted via a cloud platform for easy access

How to run the codes:

Run 
1. Preprocessing1.ipynb
2. Preprocessing2.ipynb
3. Preprocessing3.ipynb
4. MachineLearningpart.ipynb

* The above 4 files should be run in Jupyter notebook

5. Run "CAR_DHEKO_WEBAPP.py" using streamlit. Command "Streamlit run CAR_DHEKO_WEBAPP.py"
* This last file can be run either through command prompt or suitable IDE such as Visual studio.
